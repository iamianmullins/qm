## QM sub-package Sound

### Step 1: Install the QM Mount Bind Sound Package

To set up sound cards in a QM environment using Podman, follow the steps below:
Run the following commands to install the `qm_mount_bind_sound` package and restart QM (if previously in use):

```bash
# Build and install the RPM for QM sound
git clone https://github.com/containers/qm.git && cd qm
make TARGETS=sound subpackages
sudo dnf install -y rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/qm_mount_bind_sound-0.6.7-1.fc40.noarch.rpm

# Restart QM container (if already running)
sudo podman restart qm
```

### Step 2: Identify Sound Cards

After installing the drop-in and restarting QM, you need to identify which sound card in the Linux system will be used in QM. If you're familiar with your sound card setup feel free to skip this step.

To list the sound cards available on your system (in our case, we will pick the number 1):

```bash
cat /proc/asound/cards
```

**Example Output**:

```bash
 0 [NVidia         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia
                      HDA NVidia at 0x9e000000 irq 17
 1 [sofhdadsp      ]: sof-hda-dsp - sof-hda-dsp
                      LENOVO-20Y5000QUS-ThinkPadX1ExtremeGen4i
 2 [USB            ]: USB-Audio - USB Audio Device
                      Generic USB Audio at usb-0000:00:14.0-5, full speed
```

### Detecting Channels and Sample Rates

To list the supported number of channels and samples use `pactl` command:

```bash
pactl list sinks | grep -i 48000 | uniq
    Sample Specification: s24-32le 2ch 48000Hz
```

### Verify Sample Rate Support

To show the supported sample rates for a specific sound card codec, you can also inspect the codec details:

```bash
cat /proc/asound/card1/codec#0 | grep -i rates
```

This will output the supported sample rates for the codec associated with `card1`.

### Differentiating Between Cards

Accessing Card 1 (sof-hda-dsp)

```bash
cat /proc/asound/cards | grep -A 1 '^ 1 '
```

Accessing Card 2 (USB Audio Device)

```bash
cat /proc/asound/cards | grep -A 1 '^ 2 '
```

### Step 3: Testing audio inside QM

Inside QM, run the following command:

```bash
podman exec -it qm bash
bash-# podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND         CREATED      STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
76dacaa9a89e  quay.io/qm-images/audio:latest  sleep infinity  7 hours ago  Up 7 hours              systemd-audio


bash-# podman exec -it systemd-audio bash

Execute the audio test within the nested container, and the sound will be output through the physical speakers of your computerâ€”or, in this case, the car's multimedia soundbox.
bash-# speaker-test -D hw:1,0 -c 2 -r 48000
```

Params:

```bash
hw:1,0: sound card 1, device 0
-c 2: two channels (stereo)
-r 48000: sample rate of 48 kHz
```
